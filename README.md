# Data Structures and Algorithms Bootcamp

## Introduction 
This bootcamp will provide you with a complete journey from the start of what is Data Structures and Algorithms to how to implement complex types of data structures in your programs.


## Objectives
By the end of this bootcamp you will be able to
- Understand the concept of data structures  and their types.
- Understand what is an Algorithm.
- Identify which data structure to be used for specific problems.
- Use the concepts covered to build robust and maintainable programs.


## Bootcamp Structure 
To make most of your journey in this bootcamp, you need to understand how the bootcamp is structured. 

The bootcamp has **three** levels to cover data structures and algorithms concepts. 
1. [Data Structures and Algorithms 101](./data-structures-and-algorithms-101), the base concepts of data structure types and their algorithms.
2. [Data Structures and Algorithms 102](./data-structures-and-algorithms-102), time and space complexity, how to calculate it, and how to enhance it.
3. Data Structures and Algorithms 103, advanced topics in data structures and algorithms.

> The entire bootcamp consists of the idea of data -> organization -> operation. Which is described in the first-level [introduction](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp/blob/main/data-structures-and-algorithms-101/01-introduction/01-introduction-to-data-structures-and-algorithms/01-introduction-to-data-structures-and-algorithms.md). Kindly do not pass it.

> Kindly take a look at the [tools](./Tools.md) file for tools and resources to help you through you learning experience.
