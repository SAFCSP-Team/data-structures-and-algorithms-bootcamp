introduction about the bootcamp and its three levels.

# Data Structures and Algorithms Bootcamp

## Introduction 
This bootcamp will provide you with a complete journey from the start of what is Data Structures and Algorithms to how to implement complex types of data structures in your programs.


## Objectives
By the end of this bootcamp you will be able to
- Understand the concept of data structures  and its types.
- Understand what is an Algorithm.
- Identify which data structure to be used for specific problems.
- Use the concepts covered to build robust and maintainable programs.


## Bootcamp Structure 
To make most of your journey in this bootcamp, you need to understand how the bootcamp is structured. 

The bootcamp has **three** levels to cover data structures and algorithms concepts. 
1. Data Structures and Algorithms 101: will cover the base concepts of data structures types and its algorithms.
2. Data Structures and Algorithms 102: will cover time and space complexity, how to calculate it and enhance it.
3. Data Structures and Algorithms 103: will cover advance topics in data structures and algorithms.
