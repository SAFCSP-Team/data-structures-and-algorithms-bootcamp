# Introduction to Time and Space Complexity

<!--- Why is there more than one way to write/perform an algorithm --->
We know that inoder to solve a problem, we need to write a algorithm. But, what if we have more than one algorithm to solve the problem, e.g sorting an array, we can use **bubble sort, or merge sort**, and so on.

So, we have more than algorithm which solved a problem, but we need to know how to measure the performance of an algorithm, and compare between them to determine which one is the best for a given problem.

It's the **algorithm's efficiency**, and when we say efficiency, we mean **time complexity and space complexity.**

<!--- What is time and space complexity --->
**Time complexity** it's the time that an algorithm takes to complete a task. 

**Space complexity** it's the space in **memory** that an algorithm takes to complete a task.


So, We know that the time complexity and space complexity are the two main factors that effect the performance of our algorithm, and **choosing the best algorithm for a given problem is based on those two factors**.

<!--- What is the purpose of time and space complexity --->

For each computer runs the algorithm faster than the other, that's because they have different hardware capabilities, and that's why we need to have a way to measure the time and space complexity regardless of the hardware capabilities. 


<!--- Note CPU, Memory --->
> * Time complexity depends on the CPU speed, and the number of instructions that the CPU can execute in a given time.
> * Space complexity depends on the memory size, and the number of variables that the algorithm uses.


<!--- Link the big O --->

We can measure the time and space complexity for each algorithm regardless of the hardware capabilities by using the **big O notation**.
