# Introduction to Time and Space Complexity

We know that inoder to solve a problem, we need to write a algorithm. But, what if we have more than one algorithm to solve the problem, e.g sorting an array, we can use **bubble sort, or merge sort**, and so on.

We need to know how to compare algorithms and determine which one is the best for a given problem.
It's the **algorithm's efficiency**, and when we say efficiency, we mean **time complexity and space complexity.**

So, what is time complexity and space complexity, computer hardware has storage and processing those are the two main resources that we need to consider when we talk about time and space complexity. Those resources will effect the performance of our algorithm.

The CPU is effecting the time complexity, and the memory is effecting the space complexity. The more faster the CPU, the less time the algorithm will take to execute, and the more memory that the algorithm hold the more space complexity it will take.

The time complexity is the process of determining the amount of time an algorithm to complete its execution, depending on the CPU speed, and the space complexity is the process of determining the amount of memory an algorithm to complete its execution, depending on the memory size.

So, We know that the time complexity and space complexity are the two main factors that effect the performance of our algorithm, and **choosing the best algorithm for a given problem is based on those two factors**.
