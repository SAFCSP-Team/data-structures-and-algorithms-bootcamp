# Quick Sort Algorithm
Imagine you have a stack of unsorted papers with different numbers written on them, and you want to arrange them in ascending order. Each paper represents a task, and the numbers on the papers indicate their priority. You want to use `Quick Sort` to efficiently sort the tasks **based on their priority**.

Here's how Quick Sort can be applied to this scenario:

**Select a Pivot:** Choose a random paper from the stack as the pivot.

**Partitioning:** Divide the remaining papers into two groups - one group with tasks having higher priority than the pivot and the other group with tasks having lower priority. Place the pivot paper in its correct sorted position.

**Recursive Sorting:** Recursively apply the above steps to the two groups of papers until each group contains only one paper.

**Combine:** As the recursive calls return, combine the sorted groups of papers to obtain the final sorted stack.

By using `Quick Sort`, you can efficiently sort the stack of papers based on the priority numbers. This allows you to easily identify and work on tasks in the order of their importance, helping you effectively manage your workload.

## Concept

`Quick Sort` is a highly efficient and widely used **sorting algorithm** known for its **average-case performance**. It follows the **divide-and-conquer** approach to sort an array or list of elements. The algorithm selects a `pivot` element from the array and partitions the remaining elements **into two sub-arrays**, one with elements **smaller than** the `pivot` and the other with **elements greater than** the `pivot`. This process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

* the Pivot can be Picked as the first, last element or can be a random element.
