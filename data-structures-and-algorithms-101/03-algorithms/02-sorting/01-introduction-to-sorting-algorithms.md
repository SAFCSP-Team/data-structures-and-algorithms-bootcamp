# Introduction to Sorting Algorithm

To effectively **manage** contact information on smartphones or email applications, contact lists often need to handle a significant number of contacts. However, finding specific contacts within these lists can be a daunting task.

To address this challenge, `sorting algorithms` **are utilized to arrange** contacts alphabetically by name. This systematic approach offers an efficient way to **locate and access** desired contacts swiftly and conveniently.

## Concept
> Sorting is a process of rearrangement of a list of elements to the correct order since handling the elements in a certain order is more efficient than handling random elements.
