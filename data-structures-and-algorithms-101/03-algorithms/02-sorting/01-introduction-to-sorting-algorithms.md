# Introduction to Sorting Algorithm

`Sorting` is arranging items in a particular order so as to access them easily. We apply sorting in our day-to-day life in several instances.

When you need to  **manage** contact information on smartphones, contact lists often need to handle a significant number of contacts. However, finding specific contacts within these lists can be a daunting task.

To address this challenge, `sorting algorithms` **are utilized to arrange** contacts alphabetically by name, this systematic approach offers an efficient way to **locate and access** desired contacts swiftly and conveniently.

## Concept

> Sorting is a **data structure** operation, which is used for making easy **searching and arranging** of elements or records.

`Sorting algorithms` offer several benefits. They enhance data accessibility by facilitating quick searches and lookups, optimize data processing by enabling efficient algorithms that rely on sorted data, and improve the overall performance of applications that rely on sorted data.

**There are many fundamental sorting algorithms:**
* Merge sort.
* Insert sort.
* Bubble sort.
* Selection sort.
