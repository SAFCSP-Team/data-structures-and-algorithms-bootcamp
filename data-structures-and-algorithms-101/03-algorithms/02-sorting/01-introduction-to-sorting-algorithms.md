# Introduction to Sorting Algorithm

`Sorting` is arranging items in a particular order so as to access them easily. We apply sorting in our day-to-day life in several instances.

When you need to  **manage** contact information on smartphones, contact lists often need to handle a significant number of contacts. Therefore, finding specific contacts within these lists can be a daunting task.

To address this challenge, `sorting algorithms` **are utilized to arrange** contacts alphabetically by name, this systematic approach offers an efficient way to **locate and access** desired contacts swiftly and conveniently.

## Concept

> Sorting is a **data structure** operation, which is used for making easy **searching and arranging** of elements or records.


`Sorting algorithms` offer several benefits. They enhance data accessibility by facilitating quick searches and lookups, optimize data processing by enabling efficient algorithms that rely on sorted data, and improve the overall performance of applications that rely on sorted data.

**There are many fundamental sorting algorithms:**

* `Merge sort`: The idea of Merge Sort is to divide the data set into smaller data sets, sort those smaller data sets, and then join them (merge them) together.

* `Quicksort`: Is based upon partitioning the list into smaller lists (based on pivot point). Elements are arranged on the basis of whether they are smaller or larger than the pivot.

* `Bubble sort`: The simplest of all the sorting algorithms. In bubble sort, we compare each element with its adjacent neighbor and swap if it's bigger.

* `Selection sort`: Divides the array into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and places it in the sorted portion.

* `Insertion sort`: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
