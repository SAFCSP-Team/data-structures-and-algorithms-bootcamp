# Binary Search
 let`s play the [Guess Number Game](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game.html).

> is a simple game where the player enters their guesses, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. the game continues until the player guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum number of attempts (in this case, 10). 

What did you do when the Last guess was too low! Did you continue to guess numbers smaller than the last number, or did you ignore them and start trying larger numbers?

## Concept
The "guess number game" is a popular example that demonstrates the application of the Binary Search algorithm. The Binary Search algorithm is used to efficiently narrow down the search space and find the correct number with fewer attempts.
