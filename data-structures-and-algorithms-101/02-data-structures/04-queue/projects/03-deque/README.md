# Deque

### Objective

In this project, we will cover the fundamentals of the `deque`, and it's operations.

### Problem

Create a `deque` class using an `array` approach.

### Implementation

Write the implementation of the `DequeArray` class, to store the orders number on the drive through restaurants line.

> the order number is `Integer` type.

1. Write the `DequeArray` attributes, where we can store the orders.
2. Write the implemenation of the following methods:
   1. addFirst()
   2. addLast()
   3. deleteFirst()
   4. deleteLast()
3. In the main method, using the **addFirst()** method add **110** and **120** to the queue.
4. using the **addLast()** method add **130** to the queue.
5. Print the `front` and `rear` of the queue

> Run the main method to verify the implementation.

````Java
class DequeArray{
    /* Your Code Here */
  
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Your Code Here */
    }
}
