### Problem

You have a list of coffee shop orders that need to be stored, use the `queue` data structures to store the orders, and print the list.

### Implementation

Write the implemenation of the `queue` to store the orders.

1. Add the follwoing orders `["black coffe", "latte"]`.
2. Remove/`Dequeue` the two orders, then add another orders which are `["mocca", "espreso", "americano"]`
