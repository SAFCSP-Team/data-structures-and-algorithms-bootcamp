# Queue

Have you ever been in a line? we usually form a line whenever we want to be served whether it's at a coffee shop, or a bank, when we form a line the serving process will be much easier and controllable. Each new customer who comes in will join the last of the line, and the first customer in the line will be served first, after a customer gets served, they leave the line.

The same concept we use in data structure to organize the data in programs, we use a `queue`, which has the same concept as what we descirbed earlier.

> Queue is another word to describe a line.

## Concept

`Queue` is a **linear data structure**. `queue` are organized in a line/queue the first element in the queue is called`head`. The end of the element in the queue is called the `tail`. Every new element will be added at the end of the queue. The first element in the line will be processed first, once the element is processed it will be removed from the queue.

> Some resources refer to the first element in the queue as [head, front],
>
> and for the end of the element they refer to it as [rear, tail, end]

**Why we use a queue?**

To ensure that elements are processed in the order in which they were added, making it possible to manage tasks or requests in a systematic and predictable manner.

**Queue Operation**

**Enqueue**: add an element at the end of the queue.

**Dequeue**: return the last element from the queue and remove it from the queue.

> Each programming language different name eah operation
>
> * enqueue = push / addFirst
> * dequeue = pop

**Types of queue:**

* **Linear Queue**: A linear `queue` is the most basic form of a `queue`, where elements are stored in a linear manner.
* **Circular Queue**: A circular `queue` overcomes the limitation of a linear queue where the tail and head can reach the end of the underlying array or linked list.
* **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: It allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
* **Priority Queue**: Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority. If there's more than one element with the same priority, the first element added will be dequeued first.

## Example

### Primitive

#### Java

````Java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Queue queue = new LinkedList();

        // Enqueue: add to the end of the queue.
        queue.add(10);
        queue.add(20);

        // Dequeue: return the first element of the queue, and remove it.
        System.out.println(queue.remove());

        // Peek: return the first element of the queue, but don't remove it.
        System.out.println(queue.peek());

    }
}
````

**OUTPUT**

````
10
20
````

#### C++

````cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
  std::queue<int> myQueue;

  // Enqueue: add to the end of the queue.
  myQueue.push(10);
  myQueue.push(20);

  // Peek: return the first element of the queue, but don't remove it
  std::cout << myQueue.front() << std::endl;

  // Dequeue: return the first element of the queue, and remove it.
  myQueue.pop();


  // Peek: return the first element of the queue, but don't remove it
  std::cout << myQueue.front() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
````

**OUTPUT**

````
10
20
````

### Non-Prmitive

````Java
Queue<User> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        User user1 = new User("Fahad", 20);
        User user2 = new User("Faris", 25);
        User user3 = new User("Majed", 22);

        queue.enQueue(user1);
        queue.enQueue(user2);
        queue.enQueue(user3);

        queue.deQueue();

        queue.display(); // Faris, Majed
````
