# Stack
Imagine you have a stack of books on your desk. Each book is placed on top of the previous one. When you want to **add a new book** to the stack, you put it **on top**. And when you want to **remove a book**, you take the one **from the top**.

In computer programming, a stack is similar to this stack of books. It is a data structure that follows the same idea. Instead of books, we have a stack of data. We can add new data on top of the stack, and when we want to remove data, we take the one from the top.

## Concept
`Stack`: is a fundamental data structure that stores data in a specific order, where items can **only be added or removed from the top**.
- In a stack, the most recently added item is always at the top, and it is the first item to be removed. This behavior is known as **"last in, first out" (LIFO)**.
- To implement a stack, you can use an array or a linked list.
- A stack has associated the following operations:
  - top(): return the top element from the stack without removing it.
  - Pop(): remove the top element from the stack and return it.
  - Push(x): add element x to top of stack.
  - IsEmpty(): return true if the stack is empty.
  - size(): return the size of the stack.

> Java provides a built-in generic class called [Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) in the java.util package, which can hold elements of any type.
