# Introduction to Graph
You can think of the graph as releastionship between people in a social network. where Khaled is connected to Fahad and Fahad is connected to Majed, but Majed is not connected to Khaled.

## Concept
A Graph is a non-linear data structure is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as nodes, and the links that connect the nodes are called edges.

There are two components of a graph:
1. Node - A node represents an entity (object) in the graph.
2. Edge - An edge is a line or arc that connects a pair of vertices in the graph.

The way to represent a graph is using an Adjacency Matrix or Adjacency List.

> Generally, graphs are used to model probelms defined in terms of relationships or connections between objects. One example of this is a social network, where the nodes are people and the edges are friendship relationships between them.
## Implementation
[description]


## Types
There are two 
1 - Directed Graph is a graph where each edge is directed. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.


2 - Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
