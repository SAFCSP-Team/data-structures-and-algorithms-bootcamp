**Decision tree**    

**Example**     
Let's say you want to decide whether to go on a trip or not? and you want that to be decided that based on some questions:  


Did your company approved your vacation?   
Is the airline ticket availabe?   
Do you have the budget for this trip?  
   
Here is how the decision tree should be built as the following (Figuer 3) shows:

# Decision tree  
Binary tree is type of tree data structure and it will be covered in the following sections.

## Concept  
Decision tree is one of binary tree's applications. it's binary tree assoitated with decision process.
Decesion tree helps the program to decide whether to take an action or not based on specific actions/questions.   
  
  
## Example 
Let's say you want to decide whether to go on a trip or not? and you want that to be decided that based on some questions:
