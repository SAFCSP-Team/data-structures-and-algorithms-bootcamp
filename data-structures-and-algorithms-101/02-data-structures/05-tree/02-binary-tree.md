# Introduction to binary tree

Binary tree is a tree useed to store and organize hierarchical data

## Concept

A tree where every node has two child nodes (at the most)

<summary>Types of Binary Tree</summary>
<br/>

1 - Full Binary Tree
- A tree where tree nodes can have either two children or no child.
  

2 - Complete Binary Tree 
- A tree where each nodes on all levels except the last level has two children.
- A tree where at the lowest level, all leaves should reside possibly on the left side.


3 - Perfect Binary Tree
- A tree where every node must have two children and every leaf is present on the same level.


4 - Balanced Binary Tree
- `Balance factor` = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
- It balances a binary tree for each node if its `balance factor` is either -1,0 or 1. The height of the left subtree and that of the right tree can vary by at most one.


5 - Degenerate Binary Tree
- A tree where every internal nodes (parent) has exactly one child.

You looked into the different types of binary trees. Now you will see some operations you can perform on binary trees.
