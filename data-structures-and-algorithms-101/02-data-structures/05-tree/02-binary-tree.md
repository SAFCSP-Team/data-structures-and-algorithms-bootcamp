# Introduction to binary tree

Binary tree is a tree useed to store and organize hierarchical data

## Concept

A tree where every node has two child nodes (at the most)

<summary>Types of Binary Tree</summary>
<br/>

1 - Full Binary Tree
- A where tree nodes can have either two children or no child.
  

2 - Complete Binary Tree 
- A tree where each nodes on all levels except the last level has two children.
- A tree where at the lowest level, all leaves should reside possibly on the left side.


3 - Perfect Binary Tree
- A tree where every node must have two children and every leaf is present on the same level.


4 - Balanced Binary Tree
- Balance factor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
- It balances a binary tree for each node if its balance factor is either -1,0 or 1. The height of the left subtree and that of the right tree can vary by at most one.


5 - Degenerate Binary Tree
