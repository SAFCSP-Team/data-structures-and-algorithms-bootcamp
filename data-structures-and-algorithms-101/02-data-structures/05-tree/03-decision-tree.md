# Decision tree  

## Concept  
A decision tree is one of the binary tree's applications. it's a binary tree associated with the decision process.    
A decision tree helps the program decide whether to take an action or not based on specific actions/questions.   
  
  
## Example   

### Primitive  
   
Let's say you want to decide whether to go on a trip or not? and you want that to be decided based on some questions:  
  
Did your company approve your vacation?   
Is the airline ticket available?   
Do you have the budget for this trip?   
   
Here is how the decision tree should be built as the following (Figure 3) shows:
