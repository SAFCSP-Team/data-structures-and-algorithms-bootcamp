# Circular Linked List

## Concept 
 > A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle.

There are basically two types of `circular linked list`:
* **Circular Single Linked List.**
  * The address of the last node consists of the address of the first node.

* **Circular Double Linked List.**
  * The last node storing the address of the first node, the first node will also store the address of the last node.
