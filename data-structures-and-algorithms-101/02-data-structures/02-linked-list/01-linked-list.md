# Introduction to Linked List

## Concept

A `linked list` is a **data structure** that consists of a **sequence of elements called nodes**. Each node contains both the `data` and a `pointer` to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list has a pointer to null, 
`tail` indicates the end of the list.

You can use a linked list to arrange student's names in **alphabetical order**, Each student will be stored as a `node` in the **linked list**, Each `node` will contain the student name as **data** and a `pointer` (or reference) to the **next node in the list**.
