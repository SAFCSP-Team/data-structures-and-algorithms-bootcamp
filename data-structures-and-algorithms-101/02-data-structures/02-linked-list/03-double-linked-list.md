# Double Linked List.
## Concept

A `doubly linked list` is an enhanced version of a linked list that allows **bidirectional traversal**. Each `node` in a **double linked list** contains an additional pointer called the `previous pointer`, which points to the previous node in the list. This feature enables efficient **traversal** both **forward and backward** through the list. Unlike singly linked lists, where traversal is only possible in one direction.

  The bidirectional nature of a ` doubly linked list ` enables efficient implementation of operations like **reverse traversal, 
  inserting elements** before or after a given node, and **deleting** a node with direct access to it.
