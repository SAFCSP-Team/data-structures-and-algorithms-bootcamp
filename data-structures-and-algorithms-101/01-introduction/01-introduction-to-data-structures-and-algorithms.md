# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Concept
`Data Structure` is a way of organizing, storing and manipulating data. 

This definition is what most of us read about and know, and it is correct. Data structures helps us organize data and manipulate it easily. But here we will take each keyword in the definition individually and explain what it is.

### Data
First part we want to focus on is `data`, which is the raw data that we want to organize and manipulate. It is the main input for our data structures (organizations) so we will start from it. 

From the start, data structures helps us organize the data we have into an organized set. Lets imagine we have a collection of toys, if the toys are not organized then finding a specific toy will be hard and time consuming. But, if we organized these toys in a more accessible way such as putting each type of toys in a box (ex. dolls, cars, balls...) then finding a doll will be easy since it will be in the dolls box.

#### Data types
Data in our programs could be categorized as
-  `primitive`, which is the basic types including integers, doubles, booleans and characters.
-  `non-primitive` or we can call it `compost`, which is a more complex type that compose more that one primitive type such as objects.

Following the same example above, if we have an unorganized collection of data such as integers, then it will be hard for us to search or access a specific number. But, if we organize these integers using an `Array` as an example, then it is going to be easy to access, search and modify.


### Organize
Organizing data could be done using multiple ways. If we return to the toys example in data section, we can come with multiple ways to organize the toys, we can organize it as boxes by category or color or even sizes. We can also store it by using its original boxes and stack them over each others and so on. 

These are just a few examples of organizing the toys. And depending on your type of organization the accessing or searching for a toy could be easier and less time consuming.

#### Organization and Data Structure
Organization is Data Structure. When we want to organize toys, plates or books we will be structuring it in a specific way called organization aka "structure". 

So, if we want to make accessing, searching and handling some data in a program easier then we will organize it using one of the organizations types (data structures). These organizations could be array, stack, queue or any other way of organizing your data.


### Manipulate 
Manipulating means performing some actions or operations on data. So when we organize toys we can perform some actions like searching, taking and storing a toy.

> Performing actions on data such as searching for a toy could be done even without organization, but it will be hard to do and real time consuming process. So, organizing data helps us manage data and handle it much more easier and faster.

#### Manipulation and Algorithms
Manipulations means writing an operation aka "Algorithm". So, when we write an insert operation to store data on an organization then we are writing an algorithm. 

In another word, manipulation in the data structure definitions means writing algorithms to perform some actions on the data.

### Conclusion 

In conclusion, Data structures are just organizations type to use for organizing data, while algorithms are the operations we perform on these organizations and its data.


## Projects
<!-- the project should be using one of the animation tools to structure data in any way. and perform some action on it such as inserting a value -->
