# Weighted Graph
Map navigation uses weighted graphs where the vertices are the current location and destination and the edges are the roads which eventually connect to the destination, and the weights are the distance between the two locations.

## Concept
Weighted Graph is a graph in which each edge has a value. The value is referred to as the weight or cost of the edge.

# Implementation
