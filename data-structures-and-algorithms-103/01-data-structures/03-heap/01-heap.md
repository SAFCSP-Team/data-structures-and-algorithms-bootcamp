# Heap

## Concept 
`Heap` is a complete binary tree-based data structure with specific ordering properties. 
> The binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children and all leaves should reside possibly on the left side.


#### Types of Heaps:
There are two main types of heap:
`Max Heap`:The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of the parent. The greatest value is at the root.
`Min Heap`:
