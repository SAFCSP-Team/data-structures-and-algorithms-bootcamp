# Heap

## Concept 
`Heap` is a hierarchical data structure that can be implemented using various underlying structures, such as arrays or trees.  

The heap property ensures that the highest/lowest priority element is always at the root of the heap. However, there is **no specific order or relationship between nodes** at any level, so the **heap is not sorted**.

#### Types of Heaps:
There are two main types of heap:

`Max Heap` The value of each node is **less than or equal** to the value of the parent, and **the greatest value is at the root**.

`Min Heap` The value of each node is **greater than or equal** to the value of its parent, and **the smallest value is at the root**. 

#### Heap Operations
- `heapify`: Constructs a heap from an unordered array.
- `insert`: Inserts an element into the heap while Ensuring the heap property.
- `delete`: Removes an element from the heap while Ensuring the heap property.
- `peek (Find max/min)`: Retrieves the element with the highest/lowest priority without removing it.
- `Extract(Max/Min)`: Retrieves the element with the highest/lowest priority and removing it.


Heaps have various applications, like:
- Heap is used while implementing a **priority queue**.
- **Heapsort** is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort the value in ascending or descending order.
- **Binary Heap** is used for pathfinding algorithms to Find the shortest path between two points in a graph.
