# Dijkstra 
# Contents
It's an algorithm used in Weighted Graphs to find the shortest path from a specified source vertex to destination vertex.

> Use cases:
> It's used in GPS navigation systems to find the shortest path between two locations(vertices).

> How it works:
> Iterate over all the vertices and find the vertex with the lowest distance(weight) from the source vertex and add it to the shortest path.
