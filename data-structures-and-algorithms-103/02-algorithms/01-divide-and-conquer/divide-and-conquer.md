# Divide and Conquer Algorithm

Imagine you have a deck of cards that needs to be sorted in ascending order, by applying the divide and conquer approach to sort a deck of cards

* `divide` the deck into smaller subgroups.
* `conquer` each subgroup by sorting them independently.
* `combine` the sorted subgroups by merging them back together, and finally obtain a fully sorted deck.

## Concept

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking a larger problem into subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and combining the solutions of those subproblems to get the solution of the larger problem.

A divide-and-conquer is a technique of estimating a large problem by:

* Splitting the problem into sub-parts (divide)
* Resolving the related problems (conquer)
* Mixing them together will produce the final output (combine)

there are some algorithms that follow the divide-and-conquer algorithm like `Quick Sort` and `Merge Sort`.

## Implementation
