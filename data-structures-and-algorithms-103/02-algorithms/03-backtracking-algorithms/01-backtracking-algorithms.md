# Backtracking Algorithms

### Concept 
**Backtracking** is a general algorithmic technique to solve problems by **recursively exploring all possible solutions**.

**How does Backtracking work?**

1. Choose: Choose the initial step towards a solution.
2. Explore: Explore all possible options from the current choice.
3. Evaluate: Determine whether the current choice leads to a solution.
4. Backtrack: If the choice doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, undo (backtrack) the choice to the previous choice and try another option.

Types of problems solved by backtracking algorithms:

- Decision Problem: search for a feasible solution.
- Optimization Problem: search for the best possible solution.
- Enumeration Problem: try to find all feasible solutions.
